	* doc/RANK_MAX_MATCHING.lw: Fixed a bug where the algorithm did not
	  work.

	  Added a function which performs a reduction to the maximum weight
	  matching problem.

	  The algorithms now treat the graphs as directed and not
	  undirected.

	  Changed the test to check for correctness of both algorithms and
	  to compare their solutions.

	  Changed the demo to check for correctness as well.
