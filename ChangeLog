	* ChangeLog, README, VERSION, distro.sh, doc/Makefile,
	  doc/RANK_MAX_MATCHING.lw: Changed the changelog to come from the
	  CVS.

	  Changed README to incomporate the reduction algorithm.

	  Changed distro.sh to acquire the version number from somewhere
	  else.

	  Changed makefile to delete the html-manual/ directory if it
	  already exists before trying to create the manual page.

	  Changed RANK_MAX_MATCHING.lw to contain better documentation for
	  the test program. Also some lines where splits since they were
	  exceeding the page margin.

2004-10-19 18:50  michail

	* doc/RANK_MAX_MATCHING.lw: Fixed a bug where the algorithm did not
	  work.

	  Added a function which performs a reduction to the maximum weight
	  matching problem.

	  The algorithms now treat the graphs as directed and not
	  undirected.

	  Changed the test to check for correctness of both algorithms and
	  to compare their solutions.

	  Changed the demo to check for correctness as well.
