We illustrate popular matchings in bipartite graphs.

As you edit the graph, a popular matching is indicated.
The weight of an edge corresponds to its rank.

The edges in the matching are shown in red. The sliders allow you
to change the rank of an edge.

In case no popular matching exists the algorithm tries to approximate
a popular matching and outputs the unpopularity factor of the result.
